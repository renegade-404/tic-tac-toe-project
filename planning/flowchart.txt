Display Winner:
- inside currentTurn: a function that creates a span with the winning
message; it appears in the middle of the board

to a list
- take the returned output from the function as an argument for setPos function
- create a function that inserts a mark to the corresponding button's dataset 



Game display:
div.game-container
    * margin: 0, auto

                - each button is the size of its grid item
                - each button has a dataset of its position (0-1 etc.)
        
        - div.reset-button
            - button "Reset"
            - after clicking -> game resets
